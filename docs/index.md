<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</p>

*Learn how this summer at the lovely [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://wisc.edu/)*

During the School,
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF6600;">August 5&ndash;9</span>,
you will learn to use [high-throughput computing](https://htcondor.org/htc.html) (HTC) systems
&mdash;
at your own campus or
using the national-scale [Open Science Pool](https://osg-htc.org/services/open_science_pool.html)
&mdash;
to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science.

Through lectures, discussions, and **lots of hands-on activities** with experienced OSG staff,
you will learn how HTC systems work,
how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow,
and where to get more information and help.

The school is ideal for:

*   Researchers (especially graduate students and post-docs) in any research area
    for which large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process;

*   Anyone (especially students and staff) who supports researchers
    who are current or potential users of high-throughput computing;

*   Instructors (at the post-secondary level) who teach future researchers and
    see value in integrating high-throughput computing into their curriculum.

People accepted to this program will receive financial support for
basic travel and local costs associated with the School.
