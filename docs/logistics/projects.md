# Continue Your Access to the OSPool

Any US-based researcher can use the OSPool indefinitely, with no allocation 
or cost to you. Your current account is associated with a temporary "OSG School" 
project; to continue using the OSPool for your own work, we will create a long-term 
project designation for your research group. 

Please complete the following steps by September 20: 

1. Fill out the following form: [Project Creation Form](https://topology.opensciencegrid.org/generate_project_yaml)
	
	If the project name doesn't auto-populate, just fill in `OSG_School_2024`
    **Click on "Submit Manually" when done.**
	
	The form looks like this: 
	
	![Top of the form](../assets/form-example.png)
	
	This should be the option you choose at the end:

1. Send an email to support@osg-htc.org with the following: 

	1. Include the text of the project creation form (see image below)
	1. CC the PI of your research group, asking them to confirm your membership 
	in their group. If you are the PI, that should be indicated in 
	the email. 

	Yaml output to include in the email:

Once the project PI has confirmed your membership, OSG Facilitators will create a new 
project of the form `Institution_PIName`. You will receive
a notification when you are added to the new project, and a follow up email from 
the OSG faciliation team.
